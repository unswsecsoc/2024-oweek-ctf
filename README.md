# 24T1 O-Week CTF

Repository for challenges in the 24T1 O-Week CTF, with writeups and source code included so that you can run it yourself.

Want to submit your own community writeup for a challenge (even one which already has one)? Make a pull request! We love to see different approaches to solving problems.
