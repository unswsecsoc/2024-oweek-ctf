We've had our secret company password that we use for all of our accounts stolen! We managed to get a network traffic capture of the compromised computer, but we can't make any sense of it. Could you help?

## Files

- [tcpdump.dmp](tcpdump.dmp): The packet capture from the compromised computer.

### The Big Idea

Extracting files that were transferred to the remote server from the packet capture with Wireshark.

### Walkthrough

The file provided is a packet capture generated by `tcpdump`, which is a log of all the information sent by the compromised computer over the network. We can use Wireshark or an equivalent inspection tool to investigate the contents of the packet capture, which reveals a TCP connection being made to a server. By clicking `File -> Export Objects -> HTTP`, we can extract all the files that were transferred between the comprimised computer and server. The extracted artefacts seems to imply that the remote server is a file uploading service, and that an encrypted ZIP file was uploaded. Extracting the ZIP with the provided password file then reveals the flag.
