Where in the hell am I?

**Note**: Your answer should be the name of the residence, you do not need to wrap your answer with `OWEEK{}`. For example, if you think the answer is New College at UNSW, then supply `New College, UNSW` as the flag.

### The Big Idea

Looking for clues in the image itself.

### Walkthrough

The residence is numbered, there are e-scooters and purple Vote Yes stickers. The ACT was the only territory in Australia to have voted Yes in the most recent referedum and Canberra has the largest e-scooter scheme in Australia, so bets are on somewhere there. Since it's numbered and built up, probably some kind of university residence. Looking around ANU, we see the image fits with Yukeembruk.

### Flag(s)

- `Yukeembruk, ANU`
