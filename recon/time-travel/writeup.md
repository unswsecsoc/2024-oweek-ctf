I'm not crazy, I swear there used to be a different flag on the frontpage...

|  0   | There really *was* a different flag on the website.                             |
|  0   | Is there a way to visit websites which have since been changed or lost to time? |

### The Big Idea

Using the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web) to peek at a previous capture of the CTF homepage.

### Walkthrough

The Wayback Machine is a great resource for viewing archived websites that are either no longer active or have since changed, and can be particularly useful when conducting reconnaissance. For this challenge, a capture was taken with a different flag on the CTF homepage. The flag can be found by plugging in https://ctf.secso.cc and checking the earliest capture.
