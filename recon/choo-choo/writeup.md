I'm visiting a friend today, but I can't tell which stop to get off at from the picture they gave me. Could you help?

**Note**: Your answer should be the name of the stop, you do not need to wrap your answer with `OWEEK{}`. For example, if you think the answer is Hornsby station, then supply `Hornsby` as the flag.

|  0   | The danger sign and the reflection in the window will help you narrow down the mode of public transport. |
|  0   | Trains will not stop unless asked to at this station.                                                    |
|  0   | The station is **only** accessible by boat.                                                              |

### The Big Idea

Looking for clues in the image itself.

### Walkthrough

The danger sign indicates a train station and there's water adjacent to the platform, meaning it must be directly adjacent to a body of water. The island appears to be devoid of buildings, implying the station is in a non-built up area (potentially outside of Sydney). Using the free hints provided plus some searching along NSW train lines lands you at Wondabyne station.

### Flag(s)

- `Wondabyne`
