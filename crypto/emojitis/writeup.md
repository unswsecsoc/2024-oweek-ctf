### The Big Idea

Convert the emojis into binary, and then binary into a string. 

### Walkthrough

1. Open the `emojitis.txt` file in a text editor.
2. Using the "Find and Replace" feature of your chosen text editor, swap all ðŸ˜€ faces with `1` and ðŸ˜´ faces with `0`.
3. After swapping all the emojis, you should get the following binary string: `1001111 1010111 1000101 1000101 1001011 1111011 1111001 110000 1110101 1011111 1110011 1101110 110000 110000 1111010 110011 1011111 1111001 110000 1110101 1011111 110001 110000 1110011 110011 1111101`.
4. Use a [binary to string converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-string.html) to convert the binary sequence to a string with ASCII/UTF-8 encoding.
5. It's also possible to convert the whole `emojitis.txt` file programatically and a solution has been provided in the `solution.py` file.
